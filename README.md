# MarsCOMS

The Earth-Mars peer-to-peer private messaging... ok we are not yet there, but don't you think we should start working as there are people there?

MarsCOMS is a lightspeed messaging simulator between Earth & Mars, every time you send a message to a contact, the message will take the time as the speed of light needs to travel between Earth and Mars at that moment.
